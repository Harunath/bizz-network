			<p>
				<strong>BIZ LINK NETWORK PRIVATE LIMITED</strong> believes in helping
				its customers as far as possible and has a liberal cancellation policy.
				Under this policy:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made
					immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation request
					may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
					vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping
					them.
				</li>
				<li>
					BIZ LINK NETWORK PRIVATE LIMITED does not accept cancellation requests
					for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However,
					refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the
					quality of the product delivered is not good.
				</li>
				<li>
					In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report the
					same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be
					entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at
					his own end. This should be reported within the same day of receipt of
					the products. If you feel that the product received is not as shown on
					the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice
					of our customer service within the same day of receiving the product.
					The Customer Service Team, after reviewing your complaint, will take
					an appropriate decision.
				</li>
				<li>
					In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty
					from manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.
				</li>
				<li>
					In case of any refunds approved by{" "}
					<strong>BIZ LINK NETWORK PRIVATE LIMITED</strong>, it will take 6-8
					days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.
				</li>
			</ul>
